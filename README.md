Project Description
This project provides a simple way to perform sales data analysis for three products. The dataset contains information about the sales quantity, price, and date for each product. We calculate the total sales for each product and for each day, then visualize these insights using bar and line plots.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python packages:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install the required packages using the following command:


pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-data-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd sales-data-analysis
Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.

Install the required packages as mentioned in the Requirements section.

Usage
To run the analysis, simply execute the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python sales_analysis.py
This will generate the analysis and visualize the results in a set of plots.

Dataset
The dataset is manually created for demonstration purposes. It contains sales data for three products (Product A, Product B, and Product C) over three different dates. The columns in the dataset are:

Product: The name of the product sold.
Quantity: The number of units sold.
Price: The price per unit of the product.
Analysis
The analysis includes the following steps:

Load the sales data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Calculate total sales for each product and for each date:
Total sales per product = Quantity * Price.
Group the data by product and date to compute the sums.
Visualize the results:
A bar chart showing total sales per product.
A line chart showing total sales per date.
Results
After running the script, the following insights are generated:

Total Sales Per Product: A bar chart that illustrates the cumulative sales for each product.
Total Sales Per Date: A line chart that shows how total sales fluctuate over time.
